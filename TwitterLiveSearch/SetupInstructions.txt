SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. Create a Twitter Application by signing into https://dev.twitter.com/apps

2. Put your Twitter Application Key and Secret into WebConfig TWITTER_KEY and TWITTER_SECRET settings

3. Create a Pusher Application at https://app.pusher.com/ 

4. Put your Pusher Application ID, Key and Secret into WebConfig API_ID, API_KEY and API_SECRET settings

5. At https://app.pusher.com/ , create a 'Channel existence' webhook with a URL of 'mydomain.com/webhook/subscribe'. 
	(These will only work when the web application is hosted on a web-server)

	When testing locally, you will need to 'Pause' and 'Resume' the feed to get it started, as Pusher WebHooks cannot
	be sent to local machines without public URL's. Be sure to stop the application manually in IIS or it will 
	continue to search Twitter.

	You can adjust the type of Twitter search results in WebConfig, as well as how often the application checks
	for new tweets in WebConfig settings for SEARCH_TYPE and SEARCH_INTERVAL

HOW IT WORKS

1. When a user connects using a URL containing a search string, the server generates an instance of TwitterSeeker 
	and adds it to a Static ConcurrentDictionary tracking it with a GUID and storing the search string. This GUID
	is passed to the MVC View and used as a channel name to subscribe to in the Pusher application.
	
2. When the channel is subscribed to successfully, Pusher sends a Webhook to the web server which identifies the
	channel GUID (which is also the TwitterSeeker GUID). The web application gets the TwitterSeeker from the dictionary,
	and has it start searching, sending results to Pusher.

3. Pusher publishes the results on the channel, which then are sent to the user's browser and displayed in page.

4. If the user clicks 'Pause Feed', the TwitterSeeker stops searching once the current search is done and will
	restart when the user Resumes the search. When the user closes the page and breaks the websocket connection,
	a Webhook from Pusher notifies the web application to stop the TwitterSeeker associated to the channel and
	Dispose of it.
